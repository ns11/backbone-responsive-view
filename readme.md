# Just another base backbone project.

This one's got:

1. Require.js
2. Backbone (as an AMD module from [https://github.com/amdjs/backbone])
3. Lowdash (an AMD compliant replacement for Underscore [http://lodash.com/])
4. jQuery (you know jQuery right? [http://jquery.com])
5. templating using underscore microtemplates and the tpl plugin [https://github.com/ZeeAgency/requirejs-tpl]
6. Some parts of HTML5 Boilerplate [http://html5boilerplate.com/]
7. CoffeeScript for Javascript authering [http://coffeescript.org/]
8. SCSS for CSS authering [http://sass-lang.com/]

I don't have any way of compiling the CoffeeScript and SCSS as I just use LiveReload [http://livereload.com/] in my setup.
